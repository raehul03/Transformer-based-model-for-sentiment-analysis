For this project, I tried to implement a Transformer model to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of movie reviews. The goal is to classify reviews as "positive" or "negative."
IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset: A  dataset containing 50,000 labeled movie reviews (25,000 for training, 25,000 for testing).
Source: Available via TensorFlow Dataset.
